# C-Showcase
### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
* The purpose behind this project was to create a program that could take input from a file and then count the number of occurences an item had been searched for.
### What did you do particularly well?
* I think I outlined the documentation nicely so that anyone could pick up this code and easily understand the flow and functions. Along with that, I feel I made the code modular and easy to read.
### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
* I believe I could expand further on input validation by limiting the user to only search for items without allowing numbers within the search.
### Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
* The most difficult part I found to write was the formatting for displaying the info requested within the console. This is mostly because I find formatting things within the console limiting compared to writing to a UI. In order to overcome this, I made sure to use formatting functions in the output such as setw() in order to make all output appear uniform.
### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
* The fundamentals of each programming language are fairly similar and follow a similar structure. In particular, something that transfers well across all object oriented languages is keeping user access low level through the use of getters and setters within classes. This also makes the code more readable when you see something like Book.setPage() rather than Book.page = number.
### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
* In order to achieve this, I tried my best to not make any functions too big. By breaking functions down into their most basic form, you make your code more readable when the functions almost act as comments since they are many of them that can be read in a logical order.
